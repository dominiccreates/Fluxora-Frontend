# Fluxora Frontend

React dashboard and recipient portal for the Fluxora treasury streaming protocol.

## What's in this repo

- **Dashboard** — Treasury overview, active streams, and capital flow summary
- **Streams** — Create and manage USDC streams (rate, duration, cliff)
- **Recipient Portal** — View incoming streams and withdraw accrued balance

The UI is wired for a future backend API and Stellar wallet integration.

## Tech stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router

## Route Error Recovery

The route tree is wrapped in `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`. Render-time
route failures show the sanitized `ErrorPage` fallback with Try Again and Back to
Dashboard recovery actions, while full error details are logged only in dev/test.

## Theming

Light/dark theming is owned by a single `ThemeProvider` (`src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`),
which is the **only** place that writes the `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.

How a theme is chosen, in order:

1. A valid value persisted in `localStorage` under the `theme` key (an explicit
   user choice).
2. Otherwise, the OS preference via `window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")`.

Behavior:

- **No flash (FOUC):** `initTheme()` is called once in `src/main.tsx` to apply the
  resolved theme to `<html>` before React renders.
- **Follows the OS:** while the user has not made an explicit choice, the app tracks
  `prefers-color-scheme` changes live. Once the user toggles, their choice wins.
- **Cross-tab sync:** changing the theme in one tab updates all other open tabs via
  the `storage` event.
- **Hardened input:** only `"light"` and `"dark"` are accepted. Any tampered or
  corrupted `localStorage`/`storage` value is ignored, so it can never be written to
  the DOM (`data-theme`).

Consume it anywhere under the provider with the `useTheme()` hook:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "./theme/ThemeProvider";

function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Switch to {theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"} mode
    </button>
  );
}
```

`useTheme()` throws if used outside a `ThemeProvider`. The provider wraps the app in
`src/App.tsx`.

## Environment

Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) when you add API or Stellar config, for example:

- `VITE_API_URL` — Backend API base URL
- `VITE_NETWORK` — Stellar network (TESTNET / PUBLIC)
- `VITE_RPC_URL` — Soroban RPC server endpoint
- `VITE_STREAM_CONTRACT_ID` — The deployed stream contract ID (C...)

## Transaction Signing Layer (Stellar / Soroban)

Fluxora integrates with the Stellar ecosystem for on-chain stream management:
- **Freighter Wallet Integration**: Leverages `@stellar/freighter-api` to securely retrieve accounts, request network passphrases, and sign transactions.
- **Soroban Smart Contract Invocations**: Invokes contract entrypoints (`create_stream`, `withdraw`, `pause_stream`, `cancel_stream`) by building operations, simulating resource costs, and submitting signed envelopes.
- **Network Validation**: Verifies that the connected Freighter extension matches `VITE_NETWORK` before building or signing transactions, protecting users from cross-network mistakes.
- **Robust Error Mapping**: Automatically maps user rejections, simulation failures, and timeouts into descriptive toasts and inline alert messages.

## SEO and Social Previews

Search and link-preview metadata lives in `index.html`. Update the description,
canonical URL, Open Graph tags, Twitter Card tags, and absolute HTTPS preview
image there when launching a new campaign or changing the public marketing URL.

- `VITE_DEMO_MODE` - Set to `true` or `1` to render treasury overview fixture data for screenshots and tests. Leave unset for the default live-data path.

## Related repos

- **fluxora-backend** — API and streaming engine
- **fluxora-contracts** — Soroban smart contracts

Each is a separate Git repository.

Contract source and Soroban tests live in `fluxora-contracts`, not this frontend
repository. Protocol security notes in `docs/security.md` are retained here as
context for the UI, but executable contract coverage belongs with the contracts
repo so it runs in the correct toolchain and CI.
